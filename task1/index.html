    <u><h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2></u>
    <p>Sachin Tendulkar, widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time, was born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, India. Known as the "Master Blaster," he made his debut for the Indian national team at the age of 16 against Pakistan in 1989. Over his illustrious career, which spanned 24 years, Tendulkar amassed over 34,000 runs in international cricket, including 100 centuries, making him the highest run-scorer in both Test and One Day International (ODI) formats. His achievements include being the first player to score a double century in an ODI and the first to reach 100 international centuries. He was also the first player to score a century in World Cup cricket, a record that remains iconic. In 2013, he retired from international cricket, leaving behind a legacy that inspired millions. Tendulkar was awarded Indiaâ€™s highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, shortly after his retirement. His contribution to Indian cricket and global sports has been immense, earning him worldwide respect and admiration.</p>
